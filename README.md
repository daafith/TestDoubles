# TestDoubles
Test doubles are like stunt doubles, they take the place of the 'real'  thing in test code.
## Dummy Object
This is a placeholder object that is passed to the SUT as an argument (or an attribute of an argument) but is never actually used.

* We can create a dummy  [manually](https://www.testright.nl/2016/12/02/test-doubles-creating-a-dummy-object-manually/)
* We can create a dummy [with a mocking framework](http://www.testright.nl/2016/12/16/test-doubles-creating-a-dummy-object-using-a-mocking-framework/)
